This guide will help you download the zip folder for a Django application from GitHub and run it on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the installation and setup, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

Python 3.x
Git
pip

Option 1: Downloading the Zip Folder:

-> Go to the GitHub repository where the Django application is stored.
-> Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" from the dropdown.
-> Once the zip file is downloaded, extract the contents to a folder of your choice.
-> Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the contents.
-> Create a virtual environment by running the following command: python -m venv myenv
Replace "myenv" with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

On Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate

On macOS or Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate

Install the required packages by running the following command:
pip install django==3.2.18


Once the packages are installed, run the following command to start the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver
Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the Django application.


Follow the steps from Option 1 to create a virtual environment, install the required packages, and start the Django development server.

Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded the zip folder from GitHub and set up a virtual environment to run a Django application.
